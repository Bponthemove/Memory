Memory is one of my kids favourite games and the source of lots of fun (and many arguments). 
I am not into gaming, but I do love board games! Probably because of the human interaction.

When I started learning Javascript and made the classic Tic Tac Toe game as a project, I thought that it would be 
much more educational to make something that I would do completely on my own from start to finish. 
So I chose memory because of my children. 

A few months later I rebuilt it using React. This is the React code, you'll also find the js code on my github.

(please remember that Heroku puts apps to sleep when they have been visited for a certain amount of time and therefor it may take some time to load)
